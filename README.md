Practicum Integrated Project 2: Event-Based Analysis

The project for a startup that sells food products. We need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.

Outline of analysis

Loading the data, checking for duplicates and mismatched values, converting data types to the necessary formats
Study the sales funnel, find the number and share of users who performed each of these actions, define the sequence of events and find the stage at which we lose the most users
Study the results of the experiment A/A/B: check the statistically significant difference between two control group, compare each of the control group with test group, and combined control groups with test group
